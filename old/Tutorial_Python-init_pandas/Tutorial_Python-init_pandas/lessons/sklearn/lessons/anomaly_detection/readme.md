## **Anomaly Detection in Scikit-Learn**  

### **Overview**  
Anomaly detection identifies rare or unusual patterns in data that deviate from expected behavior. It is used in fraud detection, network security, medical diagnosis, and manufacturing defect detection.

## **Types of Anomaly Detection Methods**  

| **Method**                 | **Description**                                          | **Best Use Case** |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Statistical Methods**    | Detects anomalies based on probability distributions.  | Normally distributed data. |
| **Distance-Based Methods** | Identifies anomalies by measuring distance to neighbors. | Well-separated clusters. |
| **Density-Based Methods**  | Finds anomalies in low-density regions.                | Varying density data. |
| **Clustering-Based Methods** | Uses clustering algorithms to detect outliers.      | Clustered datasets. |
| **Model-Based Methods**    | Trains ML models to detect anomalies.                   | Complex, high-dimensional data. |

## **1. Isolation Forest**  
**Usage**: Detects anomalies by isolating them using decision trees.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

clf = IsolationForest(
    n_estimators=100,  # Number of trees
    contamination=0.1,  # Expected proportion of outliers
    random_state=42
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.predict(X)  # -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal points
```

### **Advantages**  
- Efficient for high-dimensional data.  
- Does not assume data distribution.  

### **Limitations**  
- Sensitive to contamination parameter.  
- May struggle with overlapping clusters.  

---

## **2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**  
**Usage**: Measures how isolated a point is relative to its neighbors.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor

clf = LocalOutlierFactor(
    n_neighbors=20,  # Number of neighbors
    contamination=0.1  # Expected proportion of outliers
)
labels = clf.fit_predict(X)  # -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal points
```

### **Advantages**  
- Works well with varying densities.  
- No explicit training phase.  

### **Limitations**  
- Sensitive to `n_neighbors`.  
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.  

---

## **3. One-Class SVM (OC-SVM)**  
**Usage**: Identifies anomalies by learning a boundary around normal data.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM

clf = OneClassSVM(
    kernel='rbf',  # Kernel type
    nu=0.1,  # Upper bound on outliers
    gamma='scale'  # Kernel coefficient
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.predict(X)  # -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal points
```

### **Advantages**  
- Works in high-dimensional spaces.  
- No need for labeled anomalies.  

### **Limitations**  
- Sensitive to kernel choice.  
- Performance degrades with large datasets.  

---

## **4. Elliptic Envelope**  
**Usage**: Assumes data follows a Gaussian distribution and detects outliers.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.covariance import EllipticEnvelope

clf = EllipticEnvelope(
    contamination=0.1  # Expected proportion of outliers
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.predict(X)  # -1 for anomalies, 1 for normal points
```

### **Advantages**  
- Effective when data follows a Gaussian distribution.  

### **Limitations**  
- Poor performance on non-Gaussian data.

## **Choosing the Right Anomaly Detection Method**  

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Method** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| High-dimensional data | **Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM** |
| Varying density data | **Local Outlier Factor** |
| Normally distributed data | **Elliptic Envelope** |
| Large datasets with unknown patterns | **Isolation Forest** |

Anomaly detection is essential for detecting fraud, cybersecurity threats, and rare medical conditions. The choice of method depends on data characteristics, computational efficiency, and interpretability.
