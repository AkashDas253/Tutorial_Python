In TensorFlow, **graphs** and **sessions** work together to create, manage, and execute the operations in a machine learning model. In TensorFlow 1.x, graphs define the computations, and sessions execute them. Although TensorFlow 2.x has shifted to eager execution by default, understanding graphs and sessions remains valuable, especially when working with lower-level TensorFlow APIs or running in compatibility mode.

### Basics of TensorFlow: Managing Graphs and Sessions

#### 1. **Computational Graph (`tf.Graph`)**

A **computational graph** in TensorFlow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operations. Every operation (e.g., addition, multiplication) and every tensor is a node or edge in this graph. By default, TensorFlow creates a global default graph, but custom graphs can also be created for flexibility.

**Creating a Graph**

To work with a custom graph, instantiate it with `tf.Graph()` and use it in a `with` block.

```python
graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(3.0, name="a")
    b = tf.constant(4.0, name="b")
    c = tf.add(a, b, name="c")
```

- **Key Methods of `tf.Graph`**:
  - **`as_default()`**: Sets the graph as the default graph for the current context.
  - **`get_operations()`**: Returns a list of all operations in the graph.
  - **`get_tensor_by_name(name)`**: Retrieves a tensor by its name within the graph.
  - **`get_operation_by_name(name)`**: Retrieves an operation by its name.
  - **`add_to_collection(name, value)`**: Adds a value to a collection within the graph, useful for organizing related operations.
  - **`get_collection(name)`**: Retrieves all values in a named collection.

Example:
```python
graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    x = tf.constant(5.0, name="x")
    y = tf.constant(6.0, name="y")
    product = tf.multiply(x, y, name="product")

print(graph.get_operations())  # Lists all operations in the graph
```

---

### 2. **Session (`tf.compat.v1.Session`)**

A **TensorFlow session** is an environment that executes operations within a graph. Sessions manage resources (like variables and caches) and execute operations in the computational graph.

**Creating a Session**

```python
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(target='', graph=None, config=None)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - **`target`** (default: `''`): Specifies a remote execution target, if any. Usually left blank for local execution.
  - **`graph`** (default: `None`): The `tf.Graph` instance that the session will run. If `None`, it uses the default graph.
  - **`config`** (default: `None`): A `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` object to specify session configurations.

Example:
```python
session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
```

**Running Operations in a Session**

To run operations, use `session.run()`, which evaluates tensors or executes operations.

```python
result = session.run(fetches, feed_dict=None)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - **`fetches`**: A tensor, operation, or list of them that you want to compute.
  - **`feed_dict`** (optional): A dictionary to feed input values to placeholders dynamically.

Example:
```python
a = tf.constant(5.0)
b = tf.constant(6.0)
c = a * b

session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
result = session.run(c)
print(result)  # Outputs: 30.0
```

---

### 3. **Combining Graphs and Sessions**

You can specify which graph a session will execute by using the `graph` parameter. By default, a session operates on the default graph, but custom graphs can be used by passing them as a parameter.

Example:
```python
graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    x = tf.constant(10.0)
    y = tf.constant(20.0)
    z = x + y

session = tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph)
result = session.run(z)
print("Result:", result)  # Output: 30.0
```

---

### 4. **Session Configuration with `ConfigProto`**

`ConfigProto` in TensorFlow provides options to configure session execution for optimized performance, memory usage, and device placement.

```python
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=False)
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - **`allow_soft_placement`**: If `True`, automatically places operations on alternative devices if the specified one isn’t available.
  - **`log_device_placement`**: If `True`, logs information about which devices each operation is placed on, useful for debugging.

Example:
```python
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True)
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
```

---

### 5. **Closing Sessions**

It’s important to release resources after finishing a session. Sessions can be closed manually or automatically using a `with` block.

```python
session.close()
```

Or use a `with` block to close the session automatically:

```python
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
    result = session.run(z)
    print(result)
```

### Example: Full Graph and Session Management Workflow

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom graph
custom_graph = tf.Graph()
with custom_graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5.0, name="a")
    b = tf.constant(3.0, name="b")
    sum_op = tf.add(a, b, name="sum")

# Create a session with custom configuration
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True)
with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=custom_graph, config=config) as session:
    result = session.run(sum_op)
    print("Sum result:", result)  # Output: 8.0
```

This code demonstrates:
- Creating a custom graph and defining operations within it.
- Configuring and creating a session to execute operations in that custom graph.
- Using the `with` block to manage the session lifecycle automatically.

### Key Points

- **Graphs** represent the computational flow of operations and tensors, allowing flexibility in defining isolated or default graphs.
- **Sessions** provide the environment to execute graphs and manage resources.
- **ConfigProto** allows configuring aspects like memory management and device placements, aiding in optimized performance.
- **`feed_dict`** enables dynamic input feeding, particularly useful when working with placeholders.

In TensorFlow 2.x, sessions are primarily used in compatibility mode. Understanding these concepts is useful when working on legacy code, deploying models, or requiring advanced graph management. Let me know if you need more details on any specific part!
