## Windows in PySimpleGUI

In PySimpleGUI, a **window** is the primary container for all the elements (widgets) and the central point of interaction between the user and the application. The `Window` class is used to create and manage the window, handle events, and update the interface dynamically.

#### `Window` Class
- **Purpose**: The `Window` class is used to create and manage a GUI window. It contains the layout, handles events, and provides methods for interacting with the window's elements.
  
  **Basic Syntax**:
  ```python
  window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout)
  ```
  
  - `layout`: The window’s content, defined as a list of rows, where each row contains a list of elements.

#### Key Methods of `Window` Class

1. **`__init__()`**: 
   - Initializes a window with a title, layout, and optional parameters (like size, resizability).
   - Example:
     ```python
     window = sg.Window('My Window', layout, size=(300, 200))
     ```

2. **`read()`**:
   - The primary method for interacting with the window, capturing events triggered by user interaction with the elements.
   - It returns the event (such as button clicks) and the current values of the elements.
   - **Syntax**: 
     ```python
     event, values = window.read()
     ```
   - `event`: Captures which event occurred (e.g., button press).
   - `values`: Captures the current state of all the input elements (e.g., text fields, checkboxes).
   - **Important Notes**:
     - The window will block on `read()` until an event occurs (or the window is closed).
     - `read()` returns a tuple: `(event, values)`. Event is the user-triggered action, and values are the current states of elements.

3. **`close()`**:
   - Closes the window and releases any associated resources.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     window.close()
     ```

4. **`refresh()`**:
   - Forces the window to refresh and update its elements.
   - Useful when elements are dynamically changed and you want the UI to reflect these changes immediately.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     window.refresh()
     ```

5. **`finalize()`**:
   - Ensures that all elements are fully initialized and ready for use, especially when making changes to elements after window creation.
   - This method should be called before interacting with elements in complex scenarios.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     window.finalize()
     ```

6. **`perform_long_operation()`**:
   - Allows long-running operations to be run in a separate thread, preventing the GUI from freezing.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     window.perform_long_operation(long_operation, timeout)
     ```

#### Window Characteristics

- **Size**:
  - Windows can be sized with the `size` parameter. If not specified, PySimpleGUI automatically adjusts the window size based on the layout.
  - **Resizable Windows**: Windows can be made resizable by passing `resizable=True` when creating the window.
  
- **Title**:
  - The window’s title can be specified in the `Window()` constructor, providing a name for the window in the title bar.
  
- **Modal vs Non-Modal Windows**:
  - **Modal Windows**: The window blocks interaction with other windows until it's closed. It’s created by default in PySimpleGUI.
  - **Non-Modal Windows**: These windows allow interaction with other windows while they remain open. To make a window non-modal, you use `window.disable()` or similar commands.

- **Window Elements**:
  - Elements (widgets like buttons, text fields, etc.) are placed in the layout of the window.
  - The layout is passed when creating the window, and it can be updated later if needed using methods like `window.update()`.

---

#### Multiple Windows
- PySimpleGUI allows multiple windows to be open at once. Each window operates independently, though event handling is done sequentially in the event loop.
- **Example of Multiple Windows**:
  ```python
  window1 = sg.Window('Window 1', layout1)
  window2 = sg.Window('Window 2', layout2)
  
  event1, values1 = window1.read()
  event2, values2 = window2.read()
  ```

- **Event Handling**: You can read events from multiple windows by calling `window.read()` for each open window in the event loop.

---

#### Window Closing and Cleanup
- Proper cleanup is necessary when closing a window, especially when dealing with multiple windows or long-running tasks.
- Always call `window.close()` to free the system resources associated with the window.
- After closing the window, any references to the window object are invalid.

### Example: Basic Window
```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the layout with an input and button
layout = [
    [sg.Text('Enter something')],
    [sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Button('Submit'), sg.Button('Exit')]
]

# Create the window
window = sg.Window('Basic Window', layout)

# Event loop
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Exit':
        break
    if event == 'Submit':
        sg.popup(f'You entered: {values[0]}')

# Close the window
window.close()
```

This code creates a basic window where the user can input text and submit it, with a popup showing the entered text.

### Summary
The `Window` class is the core of GUI applications in PySimpleGUI. It allows for easy creation, interaction, and management of windows, handling user input and events. Through methods like `read()`, `close()`, and `refresh()`, the window offers simple yet effective functionality for building event-driven desktop applications.
