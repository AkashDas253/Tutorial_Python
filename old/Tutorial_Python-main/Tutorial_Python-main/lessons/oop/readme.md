## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects**â€”instances of **classes**, which are blueprints containing **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods).

### **Core Objectives**

* Bundle data and behavior together.
* Promote code reusability and scalability.
* Model real-world entities and relationships.

### **Key Characteristics of OOP**

| Characteristic    | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Hides internal state; controls access using public/protected/private members. |
| **Abstraction**   | Shows only relevant details; hides complexity using abstract classes.         |
| **Inheritance**   | Allows a class to inherit methods and attributes from another class.          |
| **Polymorphism**  | Lets methods do different things based on object context or data type.        |

### **Benefits**

* Reduces redundancy with reusable classes
* Enhances maintainability and debugging
* Improves modularity and abstraction
* Supports real-world modeling

### **Procedural vs Object-Oriented**

| Feature         | Procedural                      | Object-Oriented                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Focus           | Functions and procedures        | Objects and classes                  |
| Data Handling   | Exposed and shared              | Encapsulated in objects              |
| Reusability     | Limited                         | High through inheritance and classes |
| Maintainability | More complex in large codebases | Easier due to modular structure      |

### **Python and OOP**

* Python fully supports OOP with dynamic typing.
* Everything in Python is an object, including functions and classes.
* OOP can be blended with procedural and functional styles in Python.

---

### **OOP Workflow in Python**

* Define a class using `class`
* Use `__init__` to initialize attributes
* Create objects (instances)
* Use `self` to access attributes/methods
* Implement inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism as needed
