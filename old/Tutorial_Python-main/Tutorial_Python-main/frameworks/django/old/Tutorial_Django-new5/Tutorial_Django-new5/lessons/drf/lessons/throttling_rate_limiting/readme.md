## **Overview of Throttling & Rate Limiting in Django Rest Framework (DRF)**  

### **Concept and Purpose**  
- Throttling restricts the number of API requests a user can make within a specific time frame.  
- Prevents API abuse, protects server resources, and ensures fair usage.  
- Rate limiting is a broader concept that includes throttling and infrastructure-level request control.

### **Types of Throttling in DRF**  

| Throttle Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **AnonRateThrottle** | Limits API requests for unauthenticated users (`'anon'`). |
| **UserRateThrottle** | Limits requests per authenticated user (`'user'`). |
| **ScopedRateThrottle** | Applies different limits to specific views (`'scope'`). |
| **Custom Throttling** | Defines custom rules based on request attributes. |

---

### **Global Throttle Configuration (`settings.py`)**  
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',
        'user': '1000/day'
    }
}
```
- **Anonymous users**: 100 requests per day.  
- **Authenticated users**: 1000 requests per day.  

---

### **Scoped Throttling**  
- Applies different limits for specific API views.  
- Example: A product listing API can be throttled separately from user authentication APIs.  

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'product_list': '50/hour'
    }
}
```

---

### **Custom Throttling**  
- Custom throttles define access rules based on business logic.  
- Example: Restrict API access to only staff users.  

```python
from rest_framework.throttling import BaseThrottle

class CustomThrottle(BaseThrottle):
    def allow_request(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_staff
```

---

### **Best Practices**  
- Set **lower limits** for anonymous users.  
- Use **ScopedRateThrottle** for API-specific control.  
- Implement **Custom Throttling** for advanced access rules.  
- Combine DRF throttling with **external rate limiting tools** (e.g., Nginx, Cloudflare).

### **Conclusion**  
Throttling in DRF helps protect APIs from excessive usage, ensuring stability, security, and fair access control.
