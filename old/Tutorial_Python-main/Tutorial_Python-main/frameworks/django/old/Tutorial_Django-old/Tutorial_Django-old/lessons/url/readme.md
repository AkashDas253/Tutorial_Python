## **Django URL Routing Cheatsheet**  

#### **URL Configuration Overview**  
- Uses `urlpatterns` in `urls.py` to map URLs to views.  
- Supports dynamic parameters and namespace-based routing.  

#### **Basic URL Mapping**  
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import my_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('home/', my_view, name='home'),
]
```

#### **Including App URLs in Project URLs**  
**Project-Level `urls.py`:**  
```python
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('app/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

**App-Level `urls.py`:**  
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import my_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('', my_view, name='app-home'),
]
```

#### **Dynamic URL Parameters**  
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import user_profile

urlpatterns = [
    path('user/<int:id>/', user_profile, name='user-profile'),
]
```
- `<int:id>` â†’ Matches integers.  
- `<str:username>` â†’ Matches strings.  
- `<slug:slug>` â†’ Matches slugs (`my-article-title`).  

#### **Passing Parameters to Views**  
```python
def user_profile(request, id):
    return HttpResponse(f"User ID: {id}")
```

#### **Reverse URL Resolution (`reverse()` & `{% url %}`)**  
- Use `reverse()` in views to generate URLs.  
- Use `{% url 'name' %}` in templates.  

```python
from django.urls import reverse
reverse('home')  # Returns '/home/'
```

```html
<a href="{% url 'home' %}">Home</a>
```

#### **Namespace in URLs**  
- Used to differentiate apps with similar view names.  

**Project `urls.py`:**  
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls', namespace='blog')),
]
```

**App `urls.py`:**  
```python
app_name = 'blog'

urlpatterns = [
    path('post/<int:id>/', post_view, name='post-detail'),
]
```

**Usage in Templates:**  
```html
<a href="{% url 'blog:post-detail' id=5 %}">Post</a>
```

#### **Redirecting URLs**  
- Use `redirect()` in views.  

```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def my_redirect_view(request):
    return redirect('home')
```

#### **Custom Error Pages**  
- Create `404.html` and `500.html` inside `templates/`.

## URL Routing in Django

URL routing is a critical component of Django's web framework. It is responsible for mapping user requests to the appropriate views. In Django, this is done through a mechanism called **URLconf** (URL configuration). The URLconf is a set of patterns that define how URLs are matched to views.

---

### **URLconf (URL Configuration)**

URLconf is a Python module that contains URL patterns and maps those patterns to views. It defines how URLs should be processed by the Django application.

The URL configuration is usually located in the `urls.py` file of a Django app or project.

#### Example of a Basic `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),  # Home page mapped to 'home' view
    path('about/', views.about, name='about'),  # About page mapped to 'about' view
    path('contact/', views.contact, name='contact'),  # Contact page mapped to 'contact' view
]
```

#### Components of URLconf:

- **`urlpatterns`**: A list of URL patterns.
- **`path()`**: A function that maps a URL pattern to a specific view.
  - The first argument is the URL pattern (as a string).
  - The second argument is the view function that handles requests matching the pattern.
  - The third argument is an optional name for the URL pattern, useful for reverse URL resolution.

---

### **URL Patterns**

A **URL pattern** is a string that specifies the part of the URL to be matched. URL patterns in Django use regular expressions, but with Django 2.0+, the recommended way to define URL patterns is using the `path()` function, which provides a simpler syntax.

#### Basic Syntax of `path()`:
```python
path('route/', view_function, name='url_name')
```

#### Examples:
- **Exact URL Match**: Matches the exact URL.
  ```python
  path('home/', views.home, name='home')  # Matches /home/
  ```

- **Dynamic URL**: Captures dynamic segments from the URL using angle brackets `< >`.
  ```python
  path('post/<int:id>/', views.post_detail, name='post_detail')  # Matches /post/1/
  ```

---

### **Dynamic URL Patterns (Capture Groups)**

Django allows dynamic segments in URLs that can capture parts of the URL and pass them as arguments to views. These dynamic segments are placed within angle brackets (`< >`).

#### Example of Dynamic URL:
```python
path('post/<int:id>/', views.post_detail, name='post_detail')
```
In this example, `<int:id>` captures an integer from the URL (e.g., `/post/1/`), and Django will pass this captured value (`1`) to the `post_detail` view as the `id` argument.

##### Common Path Converter Types:
- **`<int:id>`**: Matches integers.
- **`<str:name>`**: Matches a string (the default).
- **`<slug:slug>`**: Matches a slug (hyphenated lowercase text).
- **`<uuid:uuid>`**: Matches a UUID.
- **`<path:filename>`**: Matches a string that may contain slashes.

---

### **View Functions**

Each URL pattern is associated with a **view function**. A view function is a Python function that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. The function typically performs some business logic and interacts with models or forms to generate a response.

#### Example View Function:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to the Home page!")
```

---

### **Including URL Patterns from Other Files**

Django allows you to **include** URL patterns from other modules (typically in apps). This helps organize the URL routing better, especially in large projects.

To include a set of URLs from another file:
```python
from django.urls import include

urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),  # Includes blog app's urls.py
]
```

#### Example of Included `urls.py` for an App (e.g., `blog/urls.py`):
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),  # Blog index page
    path('<int:id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),  # Blog detail page
]
```

---

### **URL Reversal (Reverse URL Matching)**

Django provides a mechanism to **reverse** URL matching, meaning you can dynamically generate URLs from their name rather than hardcoding them.

The **`reverse()`** function is used to generate URLs by referring to their names.

#### Example of Reverse URL Matching:

```python
from django.urls import reverse
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def my_view(request):
    url = reverse('post_detail', args=[1])  # Generate URL for post with id 1
    return HttpResponseRedirect(url)
```

This will generate a URL like `/post/1/` for the view with the name `post_detail`.

You can also use `{% url %}` in templates to reverse URLs:
```html
<a href="{% url 'post_detail' id=1 %}">Post 1</a>
```

---

### **Namespace in URLconf**

For larger projects, URL patterns can be **namespaced** to avoid naming collisions, especially when the same view name is used in different apps.

#### Example of Namespacing URLs:
In your projectâ€™s root `urls.py`:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls', namespace='blog')),  # Namespaced blog URLs
]
```

Then in the `blog/urls.py`:
```python
app_name = 'blog'  # Define the namespace

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
]
```

To reverse URLs in templates:
```html
<a href="{% url 'blog:detail' id=1 %}">Blog Post 1</a>
```

---

### **URL Configuration in Class-Based Views (CBVs)**

Class-Based Views (CBVs) can also be routed in `urls.py` using `as_view()` method.

#### Example of CBV URL Routing:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import PostDetailView

urlpatterns = [
    path('post/<int:id>/', PostDetailView.as_view(), name='post_detail'),
]
```

Here, `PostDetailView.as_view()` is used to instantiate and call the class-based view.

---

### **Custom URL Matching (Using `re_path()`)**

If you need more complex matching that isnâ€™t handled by `path()`, Django provides the `re_path()` function, which allows you to use regular expressions.

#### Example with `re_path()`:
```python
from django.urls import re_path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^post/(?P<id>\d+)/$', views.post_detail, name='post_detail'),
]
```

Here, the URL pattern uses a regular expression to capture the `id` parameter.

---

### Conclusion

**URL routing** in Django is a powerful and flexible mechanism to direct incoming requests to the appropriate view. With **`path()`** and **`re_path()`**, Django allows you to define simple or complex URL patterns, pass dynamic data to views, include URL configurations from different modules, and reverse URLs for better maintainability. Understanding how to configure, include, and reverse URLs is essential for building clean, maintainable web applications in Django.
