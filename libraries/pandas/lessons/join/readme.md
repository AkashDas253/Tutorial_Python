## `.join()` – Join on Index or Column

The `.join()` method is used to combine two DataFrames based on their **index** or a **column**. It's especially useful when combining data vertically or horizontally, particularly when working with indices.

### `join()` – Syntax and Parameters

```python
df.join(
    other,                        # Other DataFrame
    on=None,                      # Column to join on (default is index)
    how="left",                   # Join type: 'left', 'right', 'outer', 'inner'
    lsuffix="",                   # Suffix for overlapping left columns
    rsuffix="",                   # Suffix for overlapping right columns
    sort=False                    # Whether to sort the result
)
```

#### **Examples:**

```python
df1.join(df2, on="key", how="inner")           # Join on column 'key'
df1.set_index("id").join(df2.set_index("id")) # Join on index
df1.join(df2, how="left", lsuffix='_left')     # Left join with suffixes for overlapping columns
```

### Key Methods and Use Cases

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `df1.join(df2, on='key')` | Joins two DataFrames on a specified column (`key`) |
| `df1.join(df2, how='inner')` | Performs an inner join between two DataFrames |
| `df1.join(df2, how='outer')` | Performs an outer join, including all rows |
| `df1.join(df2, how='left')` | Performs a left join, keeping all rows from the left DataFrame |
| `df1.join(df2, how='right')` | Performs a right join, keeping all rows from the right DataFrame |
| `df1.join(df2, lsuffix='_left', rsuffix='_right')` | Adds suffixes for overlapping column names when joining |

---

### Join Types (for `how` parameter)

| Join Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `inner`   | Only matching keys from both DataFrames |
| `outer`   | All rows from both DataFrames, `NaN` where no match |
| `left`    | All rows from left DataFrame, matched from right |
| `right`   | All rows from right DataFrame, matched from left |

---

### `on` Parameter

- **None (default):** The DataFrames are joined on their index.
- **Column(s):** When specified, the join is performed on the given column(s) instead of the index.

---

### `suffixes` Parameter

When joining two DataFrames that have overlapping column names, suffixes are added to differentiate them:

| Left Suffix | Right Suffix |
|-------------|--------------|
| `lsuffix`   | Suffix for overlapping columns from the left DataFrame |
| `rsuffix`   | Suffix for overlapping columns from the right DataFrame |

---

### `sort` Parameter

- **True:** Sort the join result by the index.
- **False (default):** Do not sort the result.

---

### Use Cases

- **Horizontal joining (combining columns):**
  - When joining DataFrames on a common index or column, `.join()` is the most straightforward way to add new columns.
- **Working with index-based joins:**
  - `.join()` is particularly useful when combining DataFrames that share a common index but may have different column names.
