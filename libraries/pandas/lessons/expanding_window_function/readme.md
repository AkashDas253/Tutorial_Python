## **Expanding Window Functions**

Expanding window functions calculate statistics on all preceding values up to the current index. Unlike rolling windows, which consider only a fixed number of recent values, expanding windows grow as more data points are included. These functions are widely used for cumulative calculations, such as cumulative sums or averages, and are useful in situations where the data is accumulated over time.

### **`expanding()` â€“ Syntax**

```python
df.expanding(min_periods=1, axis=0, method='single')
```

#### **Parameters:**

| Parameter       | Default | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `min_periods`   | `1`      | Minimum number of observations required to return a result. If not met, the result is `NaN`. |
| `axis`          | `0`      | Axis to apply the expanding operation on. `0` for rows, `1` for columns. |
| `method`        | `'single'` | Optimization flag for internal use (default for normal use cases). |

### **Common Expanding Methods**

| Method             | Description                           | Example                                    |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `.sum()`           | Expanding cumulative sum              | `df.expanding().sum()`                    |
| `.mean()`          | Expanding cumulative mean             | `df.expanding().mean()`                   |
| `.std()` / `.var()`| Expanding cumulative standard deviation or variance | `df.expanding().std()`            |
| `.count()`         | Expanding count of non-NA values      | `df.expanding().count()`                  |
| `.apply(func)`     | Apply custom logic over the expanding window | `df.expanding().apply(lambda x: x[-1])` |

---

### **Examples:**

```python
# Expanding Cumulative Sum
df.expanding().sum()

# Expanding Cumulative Mean
df.expanding().mean()

# Expanding Standard Deviation
df.expanding().std()

# Expanding Count of Non-NA Values
df.expanding().count()

# Custom Expanding Function: Last value in the expanding window
df.expanding().apply(lambda x: x[-1])
```

### **Advanced Expanding Operations**

- **Optimizing with `method` Parameter**: The `method` parameter allows for optimization of the expanding window computation. While `'single'` is the default, advanced uses may allow for different approaches depending on the performance requirements.
  
- **Expanding on Specific Columns**: The `expanding()` function works on the entire DataFrame by default. If you only want to apply it to a specific column, you can reference that column directly.

  Example:

  ```python
  df['column_name'].expanding().mean()
  ```

- **Combining with Other Methods**: Expanding functions can be combined with other pandas methods for more complex operations, such as using `.apply()` with custom logic or creating cumulative transformations that consider the entire dataset up to the current point.

### **Use Cases for Expanding Window Functions:**

- **Cumulative Calculations**: Expanding windows are useful when the goal is to perform cumulative calculations, such as calculating a running total or average over time.
- **Time-Series Data**: In time-series analysis, expanding windows are often used for cumulative statistics to track trends or overall behavior over a period.
- **Financial Analysis**: In financial data analysis, cumulative sums or averages are frequently calculated using expanding windows, particularly for metrics like moving averages or cumulative returns.
- **Signal Processing**: Expanding window functions can help accumulate or smooth data over a growing period, useful in applications like filtering or trend analysis in signals.

### **Key Differences Between Rolling and Expanding Windows:**

| Type            | Rolling Window                          | Expanding Window                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Window Size** | Fixed window size                       | Window size grows as more data is included |
| **Use Case**    | Used for calculations based on recent data points | Used for cumulative calculations over time |
| **Examples**    | Moving averages, sums, etc.             | Cumulative sums, averages, etc.          |
