#### **Basic / Fundamental**

* **How to create a basic test case**
* **How to run tests from the command line**
* **How to use `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc.**
* **How to name test functions for discovery (`test_*`)**
* **How to use `unittest.main()`**
* **How to check if code raises an exception with `assertRaises()`**
* **How to group tests into a test class**
* **How to use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` for per-test configuration**

---

#### **Intermediate**

* **How to skip a test conditionally using `@skipIf`, `@skipUnless`**
* **How to mark a test as expected to fail using `@expectedFailure`**
* **How to group multiple tests using `TestSuite`**
* **How to run tests with different verbosity levels**
* **How to use `setUpClass()` and `tearDownClass()` for class-level setup**
* **How to use `assertIn`, `assertIsNone`, `assertIsInstance` for better test conditions**
* **How to write reusable test utilities across files**
* **How to use `unittest.TestLoader` to load tests manually**

---

#### **Advanced**

* **How to use `unittest discover` for automatic test discovery**
* **How to patch objects/methods with `unittest.mock.patch()`**
* **How to mock return values or side effects with `Mock()` or `MagicMock()`**
* **How to assert mock method calls and arguments**
* **How to use `subTest()` to handle parameterized tests without breaking**
* **How to create and run a custom test runner**
* **How to organize test cases across multiple modules**
* **How to generate XML/HTML reports using third-party tools**
* **How to integrate `unittest` with CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)**
* **How to combine `unittest` with `coverage.py` for test coverage**
* **How to handle asynchronous code (with `asyncio` support in Python 3.8+)**
* **How to override `run()` or `__call__()` to customize test behavior**
* **How to write your own assertion helpers for repeated test logic**
