# Third-Party Components in Streamlit

Third-party components in Streamlit are built by the community and offer additional functionalities that go beyond the default set of Streamlit components. These components are available as Python packages and can be easily integrated into Streamlit applications to enhance user interactivity, visualization, and customization.

## What are Third-Party Components?

Third-party components are Streamlit extensions created by other developers, often leveraging web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These components can be installed using **pip** and used like regular Streamlit widgets.

### Benefits of Third-Party Components
- **Extended functionality**: Add custom features not available in Streamlit’s default library.
- **Enhanced UIs**: Integrate sophisticated visualizations and widgets with minimal effort.
- **Time-saving**: Quickly embed advanced features, such as complex charts, maps, or form elements, without building them from scratch.

## How to Install Third-Party Components

Most third-party components can be installed using **pip**, just like regular Python libraries. Once installed, you can use them directly within your Streamlit app.

### Installation Syntax:
```bash
pip install <component_name>
```

For example, to install **Streamlit Ag-Grid**:
```bash
pip install streamlit-aggrid
```
