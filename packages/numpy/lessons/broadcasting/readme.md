## **Broadcasting in NumPy**  

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes without making explicit copies. It expands smaller arrays to match larger ones while maintaining efficiency.

---

### **Broadcasting Rules**  
NumPy follows these rules when applying broadcasting:  
- **Rule 1**: If the arrays have different ranks (dimensions), prepend `1` to the shape of the smaller array.  
- **Rule 2**: Two dimensions are compatible when they are **equal** or **one of them is 1**.  
- **Rule 3**: If all dimensions match after applying Rules 1 and 2, broadcasting occurs.

### **Broadcasting Behavior**  

| Operation | Description | Example Shapes |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Scalar and Array | A scalar is broadcast to match an array's shape. | `(1,) + (n,) → (n,)` |
| Vector and Matrix | A 1D array is broadcast across a 2D matrix. | `(1, n) + (m, n) → (m, n)` |
| Two Matrices | If compatible, matrices expand to a common shape. | `(m, 1) + (1, n) → (m, n)` |

### **Syntax and Usage**  

| Operation | Description | Syntax |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Adding scalar to array** | Scalar expands to match the array. | `result = arr + scalar` |
| **Adding arrays of different shapes** | Smaller array is broadcasted. | `result = arr1 + arr2` |
| **Multiplying matrix and vector** | Vector is broadcasted along rows or columns. | `result = matrix * vector` |

### **Avoiding Broadcasting Issues**  
- Ensure dimensions match broadcasting rules.  
- Use `np.newaxis` or `reshape()` to explicitly adjust shapes.  

| Method | Description | Syntax |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| `newaxis` | Expands dimensions explicitly. | `arr[:, np.newaxis]` |
| `reshape()` | Reshapes array to match broadcasting rules. | `arr.reshape(shape)` |

### **Summary**  
- **Broadcasting allows operations on different-shaped arrays without explicit copying.**  
- **Follows dimension expansion rules for compatibility.**  
- **Use `newaxis` or `reshape()` to adjust shapes when needed.**
