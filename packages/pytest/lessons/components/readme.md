---

### **4. pytest.param**

* **Usage**: Helps define parameterized tests, used within `pytest.mark.parametrize`.

  * **Submodules**:

    * **pytest.param**: The base class for parameterizing test functions.

---

### **5. pytest.mark.skipif**

* **Usage**: Conditional skipping of tests, dependent on conditions like environment variables.

    * **pytest.mark.skipif(condition)**: Skip tests if the condition is met.
    * **pytest.mark.skip**: Always skip the marked test.
    * **pytest.mark.xfail(reason)**: Marks the test as expected to fail.

---

### **6. pytest.main**

---

### **9. pytest.xfail**

* **Usage**: Indicates that a test is expected to fail.

  * **Submodules**:

    * **pytest.mark.xfail**: Used to mark tests as expected failures.
    * **pytest.mark.xfail(strict=False)**: Set whether an expected failure should cause the test to fail the suite.

    * **pytest.reporting.config**: Configuration options related to test reporting.
    * **pytest.reporting.html**: HTML reporting output for test runs.
    * **pytest.reporting.junitxml**: XML-based test reporting format for integration with CI tools.

---

### **12. pytest-xdist (Plugin)**

* **Usage**: This plugin enables parallel test execution and distribution of tests across multiple CPUs.
