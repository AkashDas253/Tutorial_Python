## Test Organization

### Test Suite Structure

A typical Pytest test suite includes the following structure:

```
project/
│
├── src/              # Application source code
├── tests/            # Test code
│   ├── test_example.py
│   ├── test_utils.py
│   ├── conftest.py   # Fixtures for the project
│   └── test_submodule/
│       └── test_feature.py
└── pytest.ini        # Pytest configuration file
```

* **Test files**: Located in the `tests/` directory, files must start or end with `test_` for Pytest to discover them.
* **Test functions**: Functions inside the test files should begin with `test_`.
* **Test modules**: Can include multiple test files. Tests are organized into classes, functions, and modules.
* **Test classes**: Tests can be grouped in classes, although they are not required. Class names must start with `Test` (without `__init__` methods).

### Test Discovery and Execution

* **Test discovery**: Pytest automatically finds tests based on the naming conventions.

  * Test files: `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`
  * Test functions: `test_*`
* **Run all tests**: Simply use `pytest` to run all tests in the current directory and subdirectories.

### Organizing Tests with Directories

* **Test directories**: Group tests by feature or functionality.

```plaintext
tests/
├── auth/
│   ├── test_login.py
│   └── test_signup.py
└── utils/
    └── test_helpers.py
```

* **Submodule organization**: Nested test directories can organize tests further by submodules or functionality.

### Grouping Tests with Markers

* **Grouping tests by functionality**: You can use markers to group tests by categories like `slow`, `network`, `integration`, etc.

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_database_integration():
    assert db_connection()
```

* **Running specific groups**: Use `-m` to run tests of a specific group.

```bash
pytest -m "integration"
```

### Use of Test Classes

Test classes can be used to group related tests together:

```python
class TestDatabase:
    def test_connect(self):
        assert db.connect()

    def test_query(self):
        assert db.query("SELECT * FROM table")
```

* Class names must start with `Test` for Pytest to recognize them.
* Methods within the class should be prefixed with `test_`.

### Using `conftest.py` for Shared Fixtures

* **Shared fixtures**: Place shared fixtures in `conftest.py` to avoid duplication across test files.

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

### Organizing Tests with `pytest.ini`

* **Configuration file**: Use `pytest.ini` to define global configurations and markers.

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow
    integration: marks tests as requiring external resources
```

### Test Suites and Test Runners

* **Test suites**: Group tests into suites and run them together.

```bash
pytest tests/integration/
```

* **Running tests**: You can specify the test paths and file names to execute specific tests.

```bash
pytest tests/test_feature.py
```

### Test Output Control

* **Verbose output**: Add `-v` for more detailed output.

```bash
pytest -v
```

* **Quiet mode**: Use `-q` to suppress less important output.

```bash
pytest -q
```
