## **Clustering Algorithms in Scikit-Learn**  

### **Overview**  
Clustering algorithms group similar data points based on specific similarity measures. They are widely used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and exploratory data analysis.

## **Types of Clustering Algorithms**  

| Algorithm | Description | Best Use Case |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **K-Means** | Divides data into `k` clusters by minimizing variance. | Well-separated clusters in structured data. |
| **DBSCAN** | Groups data based on density, detects outliers. | Non-spherical clusters, noise handling. |
| **Agglomerative Clustering** | Builds clusters hierarchically. | Hierarchical relationships in data. |
| **Mean Shift** | Groups data by estimating density peaks. | Variable cluster sizes without `k` input. |
| **OPTICS** | Orders points based on density reachability. | Large datasets with varying density. |
| **Spectral Clustering** | Uses graph theory for clustering. | Complex-shaped clusters in small datasets. |
| **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** | Probabilistic model assuming data comes from multiple Gaussian distributions. | Overlapping clusters, soft clustering. |

## **1. K-Means Clustering**  
**Usage**: Groups data into `k` clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

clf = KMeans(
    n_clusters=3,      # Number of clusters
    init='k-means++',  # Initialization method
    max_iter=300,      # Max iterations for convergence
    n_init=10,         # Number of initializations
    random_state=42    # Random seed for reproducibility
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.predict(X)
```

### **Choosing `k`**  
- **Elbow Method**: Plot inertia vs. `k` and find the "elbow" point.  
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well samples fit their clusters.  

---

## **2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**  
**Usage**: Identifies clusters based on density and detects outliers.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

clf = DBSCAN(
    eps=0.5,         # Maximum distance between points in a cluster
    min_samples=5    # Minimum samples in a neighborhood
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.labels_
```

### **Advantages**  
- Handles arbitrary-shaped clusters.  
- Detects noise points as outliers.  

### **Limitations**  
- Sensitive to `eps` and `min_samples`.  
- Struggles with varying densities.  

---

## **3. Agglomerative Clustering**  
**Usage**: Forms a hierarchy of clusters using different linkage methods.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

clf = AgglomerativeClustering(
    n_clusters=3,    # Number of clusters
    linkage='ward'   # Linkage method: 'ward', 'complete', 'average'
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.labels_
```

### **Linkage Methods**  
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ward** | Minimizes variance within clusters (default). |
| **Complete** | Merges clusters with the largest distance. |
| **Average** | Uses the mean distance between clusters. |

---

## **4. Mean Shift Clustering**  
**Usage**: Groups data by estimating density peaks.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import MeanShift

clf = MeanShift(
    bandwidth=2.0    # Radius around each point for density estimation
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.labels_
```

### **Advantages**  
- Does not require `k`.  
- Works well for uneven cluster sizes.  

### **Limitations**  
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.  

---

## **5. OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Clustering Structure)**  
**Usage**: Orders points based on density reachability to detect varying-density clusters.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import OPTICS

clf = OPTICS(
    min_samples=5,   # Minimum number of points in a cluster
    max_eps=0.5      # Maximum distance for cluster merging
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.labels_
```

### **Advantages**  
- Works for datasets with varying densities.  
- Handles noise well.  

### **Limitations**  
- Computationally expensive.  

---

## **6. Spectral Clustering**  
**Usage**: Uses graph-based approaches to find clusters in non-Euclidean spaces.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering

clf = SpectralClustering(
    n_clusters=3,      # Number of clusters
    affinity='rbf',    # Similarity measure: 'nearest_neighbors', 'rbf'
    random_state=42
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.labels_
```

### **Advantages**  
- Captures complex cluster structures.  
- Suitable for non-Euclidean spaces.  

### **Limitations**  
- Expensive for large datasets.  
- Requires precomputed similarity matrix.  

---

## **7. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**  
**Usage**: Assigns probabilities for each data point belonging to a cluster, allowing soft clustering.  

### **Syntax**  
```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

clf = GaussianMixture(
    n_components=3,   # Number of mixture components
    covariance_type='full',  # Covariance type: 'full', 'tied', 'diag', 'spherical'
    random_state=42
)
clf.fit(X)
labels = clf.predict(X)
```

### **Advantages**  
- Soft clustering allows overlap.  
- Works well for normally distributed clusters.  

### **Limitations**  
- Computationally expensive.  
- Requires choosing the correct number of components.
