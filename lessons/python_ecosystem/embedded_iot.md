# Python Ecosystem for Embedded Systems & IoT

## Core Role of Python

Python in Embedded Systems & IoT is primarily used for **rapid prototyping, device control, automation, and cloud integration**, though lower-level programming (C/C++) often handles real-time constraints. Python acts as the bridge between **hardware (sensors, actuators, microcontrollers)** and **software ecosystems (data processing, analytics, and cloud services)**.

## Key Characteristics

* High-level scripting for quick prototyping
* Libraries to access GPIO, I²C, SPI, UART
* Frameworks for IoT data pipelines and protocols (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LoRaWAN)
* Cross-platform support (microcontrollers, SBCs like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)
* Integration with AI/ML models for **Edge AI**
