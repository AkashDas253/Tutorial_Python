# Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

## Operators

- `in` : Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
- `not in` : Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

## Examples

```python
# in operator
print('a' in 'apple')  # Output: True

# not in operator
print('b' not in 'apple')  # Output: True
```
