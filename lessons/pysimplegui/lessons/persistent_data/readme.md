## Persistent Data in PySimpleGUI

Persistent data in PySimpleGUI allows you to save and load user-specific information or application states between sessions. This is useful for creating applications that remember user preferences, last opened files, or other important settings that should be retained across program runs.

### Methods for Handling Persistent Data

1. **Using Files (Text, JSON, or Binary)**:
   - PySimpleGUI does not have built-in persistent storage features, but you can store data in external files (e.g., text, JSON, or binary files). This allows data to persist even after the application is closed.

2. **Using the `sg.user_settings_filename()`**:
   - PySimpleGUI provides a way to store persistent user settings in a file via the `sg.user_settings_filename()` method, which points to a default user settings file (usually in the user's home directory).

### Storing and Retrieving Data

1. **Saving Data Using `sg.user_settings_filename()`**:
   - You can save application state or user settings in a file. PySimpleGUI handles the creation of the settings file, and you can save key-value pairs in it.
   
   - **Function**: `sg.user_settings_filename()` returns the file path where the user settings will be stored.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import PySimpleGUI as sg
     settings_file = sg.user_settings_filename()
     print(f'User settings will be stored in: {settings_file}')
     ```

2. **Using `sg.save_settings()`**:
   - The `sg.save_settings()` method stores data (key-value pairs) in the settings file. This function is useful for saving user preferences or application states.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     sg.save_settings('user_settings.json', {'theme': 'DarkGrey5', 'window_size': (800, 600)})
     ```

3. **Using `sg.load_settings()`**:
   - The `sg.load_settings()` method loads data from the settings file. It can read JSON files and return the saved key-value pairs.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     settings = sg.load_settings('user_settings.json')
     print(settings)
     ```

4. **Custom File-based Persistence**:
   - For more control, you can manually save and load data using custom file formats like JSON, text, or CSV. This is particularly useful if you need to handle more complex data structures or large amounts of data.
   
   - **Example (JSON)**:
     ```python
     import json
     data = {'theme': 'DarkGrey5', 'window_size': (800, 600)}

     # Save to file
     with open('settings.json', 'w') as f:
         json.dump(data, f)

     # Load from file
     with open('settings.json', 'r') as f:
         loaded_data = json.load(f)
     print(loaded_data)
     ```

5. **Using Pickle for Binary Data**:
   - For more complex data structures (e.g., Python objects), you can use the `pickle` module to serialize and save the data to a binary file.
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import pickle
     data = {'theme': 'DarkGrey5', 'window_size': (800, 600)}

     # Save to binary file
     with open('settings.pkl', 'wb') as f:
         pickle.dump(data, f)

     # Load from binary file
     with open('settings.pkl', 'rb') as f:
         loaded_data = pickle.load(f)
     print(loaded_data)
     ```

### Benefits of Persistent Data

- **User Experience**: Persistent data enhances the user experience by remembering settings, preferences, and the application's state across sessions.
  
- **Customization**: Users can customize the application settings (like themes or window size) once, and the app will apply these settings automatically the next time it is launched.
  
- **Session Management**: Persistent data can help manage user sessions, such as saving the last opened file or the last used feature, and restoring them when the app starts.

### Example: Saving and Loading Theme Settings

Here's an example of how to save and load the theme settings for a user:

1. **Save Settings**:
   - Save the theme choice and window size when the user exits or clicks a save button.
   
   ```python
   import PySimpleGUI as sg

   def save_user_settings():
       theme = sg.theme()
       window_size = (600, 400)
       sg.save_settings('user_settings.json', {'theme': theme, 'window_size': window_size})

   save_user_settings()
   ```

2. **Load Settings**:
   - On application startup, load the settings and apply them.
   
   ```python
   import PySimpleGUI as sg

   def load_user_settings():
       settings = sg.load_settings('user_settings.json')
       if settings:
           sg.theme(settings['theme'])
           window_size = settings['window_size']
       else:
           sg.theme('DarkGrey5')
           window_size = (600, 400)
       return window_size

   window_size = load_user_settings()

   layout = [
       [sg.Text('This is a themed window')],
       [sg.Button('OK')]
   ]
   window = sg.Window('Persistent Data Example', layout, size=window_size)
   window.read()
   window.close()
   ```

### Summary

Persistent data in PySimpleGUI allows applications to store and retrieve user settings, window states, and other information across sessions. By using built-in methods like `sg.save_settings()` and `sg.load_settings()`, as well as custom approaches such as using JSON or `pickle` for serialization, you can create applications that remember user preferences and application states, improving user experience and overall functionality.
