# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

## Operators

- `=` : Assigns value from right side operands to left side operand
- `+=` : Adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
- `-=` : Subtracts right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
- `*=` : Multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand
- `/=` : Divides left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand

## Examples

```python
# Simple assignment
a = 10
print(a)  # Output: 10

# Add and assign
a += 5
print(a)  # Output: 15

# Subtract and assign
a -= 3
print(a)  # Output: 12
```
