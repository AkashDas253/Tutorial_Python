## Authentication/Authorization in Streamlit

#### **Overview**
Streamlit doesn't natively provide built-in features for user authentication and authorization, but it can be integrated with third-party solutions to secure applications. Authentication determines the identity of a user, while authorization controls access based on the user's permissions.

You can implement authentication and authorization in Streamlit apps through:

- **OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub)**
- **Custom authentication systems**
- **Third-party packages**

#### **Authentication Methods**
1. **OAuth Integration**
   - Streamlit allows integration with OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, or any OAuth-compatible service.
   - Typically, you can use external Python libraries (e.g., `authlib`, `flask_oauthlib`, `streamlit_authenticator`) to handle OAuth authentication.

2. **Custom Authentication System**
   - You can create custom authentication mechanisms using Streamlit's session state to manage user sessions after a successful login.
   - This can include username/password combinations or other custom forms of authentication, typically integrated via a backend server.

3. **Third-party Packages**
   - Libraries like `streamlit_authenticator` allow easier integration with built-in login forms and session management.
   - Example package: `streamlit_authenticator` provides login widgets, hashed password management, and user sessions.

#### **Implementation Example: Using `streamlit_authenticator`**

**Install the required package:**

```bash
pip install streamlit-authenticator
```

**Example code for Authentication:**

```python
import streamlit as st
import streamlit_authenticator as stauth
from yaml import safe_load

# Load credentials from a YAML file
with open("credentials.yaml") as file:
    config = safe_load(file)

# Create an authenticator object
authenticator = stauth.Authenticate(config['credentials'], config['cookie']['name'], config['cookie']['key'])

# Login form
name, authentication_status, username = authenticator.login('Login', 'main')

if authentication_status:
    st.write(f'Welcome {name}')
else:
    st.warning("Please enter a valid username and password.")
```

In the above code:
- The `credentials.yaml` file contains user credentials.
- The `login()` function creates a login form and returns the authentication status along with the user's name.

#### **Authorization**
Once authenticated, you can manage user access based on their roles or permissions. Streamlit doesn’t inherently have a user role system, so you'd need to implement this manually using session states or integrate a custom solution.

For example, you could define roles and set different permissions within the app:

```python
if authentication_status:
    if username == "admin":
        st.write("Welcome, Admin!")
        # Provide admin-level functionality
    elif username == "user":
        st.write("Welcome, User!")
        # Provide user-level functionality
    else:
        st.write("User role not recognized")
```

In this case, you check the `username` to determine what level of access the user should have and display different content accordingly.

---

#### **Session Management**
For managing user sessions, Streamlit’s `session_state` can be used to store the user’s login status across multiple pages:

```python
if authentication_status:
    st.session_state['authenticated'] = True
else:
    if 'authenticated' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state['authenticated'] = False

if st.session_state['authenticated']:
    st.write("You are logged in.")
else:
    st.write("Please log in.")
```

This ensures that users remain authenticated until they log out or the session expires.

---

#### **Handling Session Expiry and Logout**
You can implement session expiry or manual logout by using `st.session_state` to clear the session.

**Logout Example:**

```python
if st.button('Logout'):
    st.session_state.clear()  # Clears all session data
    st.write("You have been logged out.")
```

#### **Secure the Application**
When handling authentication:
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to secure data transmission, especially login credentials.
- **Password Hashing**: Use libraries like `bcrypt` to hash and securely store passwords.
- **Session Management**: Ensure proper session timeout or expiration after user inactivity.
- **Access Control**: Ensure proper authorization checks for different parts of the app (e.g., admin vs. user permissions).

---

#### **Third-party Authentication Services**
- **Auth0**: Provides a complete authentication and authorization solution, including social login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **Firebase Authentication**: Easily integrates with Streamlit for handling user authentication.
- **Okta**: Another popular option for authentication and role-based access.

---

### **Conclusion**
While Streamlit doesn’t offer built-in authentication and authorization features, it’s possible to secure apps with the help of third-party packages or custom implementations. Integrating an external solution like OAuth or using a package such as `streamlit_authenticator` allows you to easily manage user authentication and session handling.
